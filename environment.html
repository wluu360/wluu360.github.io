                            to as <i>fish-lizards</i>. They were widespread across the Northern hemisphere
                             in the Early Triassic, and were also found in the Southern hemisphere by
                              Late Triassic. They were cold-blooded, therefore 
                              relied on external heat to maintain their internal temperature and living in
                               water may have been disadvantageous since it is more efficient at removing 
                               heat than air. However, they were still suitable to live in aquatic environments more 
                               than mammals and birds, as long as surface water temperature was about 20°C.<br><br> 
                                Ichthyosaurs had extremely large eyes, which is believed to be an adaptation
                                 for low-light environments especially at deeper depths because having larger 
                                 eyes meant that they were able to collect or gather larger amounts of light. 
                                 On top of that, because ichthyosaurs evolved a fish-like form, 
                                 they were able to not only swim fast and far but also dive more deeply, 
                                 especially knowing that they also had large eyes to accommodate for the low 
                                 light environment at deeper depths. However, because they needed 
                                 to swim to the surface for air, they could not have lived too deep in the ocean. <br><br>
                                 Therefore, considering the combination of all these defining features, 
                                 they have often been associated to living in the pelagic zone, where they are 
                                 neither close to the bottom nor near the shore of the ocean.

                             in Torres del Paine National Park of Southern Chile, there have been found abundant 
                             and very well preserved remnants of ichthyosaurs.<br><br> The Tyndall Glacier represents one 
                             of the fossil Lagerstätten for Early Cretaceous marine reptiles worldwide. It is believed
                              that so many remnants of ichthyosaurs can be found in this region because Tyndall ichthyosaurs
                               benefitted from the cold upwelling currents that allowed for abundant life at the shelf edge 
                               and that included abundance of their preferred diet of belemnites and small fish.<br><br> Also, many 
                               pregnant females, neonates, juveniles and adult ichthyosaurs have been found in the Tyndall 
                               deposit, suggesting that the upslope environment was beneficial in terms of food and 
                               reproduction.
