                        Earlier ichthyosaurs were undulating creatures with long bodies and swam similarly to eels. 
                        This motion can be described as wave-like. As they evolved, their bodies began to closely
                         resemble that of a fish, such as a tuna, even eventually acquiring a dorsal fin. Its body
                        was designed to swim very fast, and was capable of reaching speeds up to 40 km/h. <br><br> 
                        It had a very powerful tail that allowed it to travel at great speeds, and had fins that 
                        were small and stiff that were like paddles, which let it maneuver up and down in the water.
                         Although the ichthyosaur lived in the water, they did not have gills that allowed them to
                          breath underwater. As a result, the ichthyosaur relied on periodic surfacing to obtain air,
                           much like modern whales today. Ichthyosaurs possessed much smaller red blood cells compared
                            to a modern day mammal in order to increase the efficiency of oxygen intake. The size 
                            difference was nearly 5 times smaller than that of a human. This occurrence was likely
                             due to the low atmospheric oxygen content during the Jurassic period. <br><br><br><br>
                        
                        <span style="color: #00334d; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #527a7a"><i>BIRTH</i></span><br><br> 
                        Although many modern reptiles give birth to eggs, that was not the case for Ichthyosaurs. 
                        The birth method of ichthyosaurs was unknown for a long time until a fossil was found in 
                        South Majiashan, China in 2011. The fossil was of a Ichthyosaur mother and was found to be 
                        carrying at least three offspring, with the second offspring half way out of the birth canal.
                         This discovery revealed that ichthyosaurs not only had live-birth but gave birth head first,
                        similar to most land animals.

                    <p>Just as many animals consume nutrients to survive, ichthyosaurus are not an exception. 
                        These prehistoric marine reptiles were strictly carnivores. The diet of ichthyosaurus
                         mostly consisted of fish, with some reptiles and ancient cephalopods also included in
                          their feeding; however, the range of their diet depended on the morphology of the 
                          different types of ichthyosaurus.<br><br> 
                         For instance, some ichthyosaurus had pointed snouts, such as the genus Eurhinosaurus, 
                         which led to the hunting of smaller animals. These species of ichthyosaurus were speculated
                          to use their snouts to slash prey, akin to modern day swordfish. Most ichthyosaurus also 
                          contained large eyes suggesting that these predators hunted at night or at great depths.
                          Evidence to suggest this is shown in modern day large or colossal squids, in which their 
                          anatomy contains large eyes that aid in hunting at specific locations at night.
                         <br><br>Some species were even able to hunt prey of its own size. 
                        These ichthyosaurus contained large bladed teeth and were known as macro predators: 
                        predators that are fairly large to the naked eye.  Some examples of these Ichthyosaurus
                         are found in the genus of Thalattoarchon, Himalaysaurus, and several species in the 
                         Temnodontosaurus.<br><br>Evidence for these findings have been
                         discovered through coprolites and fossilized stomach contents of ichthyosaurs. 
                         Coprolites are fossilized feces which, when identified, were found to contain the remains
                          of specific diets of the species it pertained to. Another evidence for their diet was 
                          found in fossilized stomach contents. These remains contained large amounts of fossilized 
                          cephalopod beaks, scale remnants, partly digested fish, and even Ichthyosaurus.
