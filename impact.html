                                made of an Ichthyosaur fossil on the beach at Lilstock, Somerset (UK), which included several 
                                pieces of bone that together measured one meter in length. After analysis, it was determined 
                                to represent an incomplete bone from the lower jaw of a giant Ichthyosaur. <br><br> This discovery was 
                                significant because this bone was compared to four other similar bones that were previously 
                                found and identified as part of a dinosaur. Through this comparison, it was realized that 
                                those previously found bones were not actually of a dinosaur but in fact, were also jaw 
                                fragments of giant Ichthyosaurs. <br><br>  The bone of the Ichthyosaur that was discovered in Lilstock
                                 has allowed us to discover past mistakes and misidentifications, and perhaps shows us that
                                  with continued testings and new findings, we can continue to refine our research, and come
                                   to new and more accurate conclusions.

                                An exceptionally preserved ichthyosaur fossil was discovered in Germany, 
                                with chemical traces of 180 million year old skin fragments and cells. These 
                                discoveries have lead to scientist believe that Ichthyosaurs may have had whale-like
                                 layers of blubber under their skin. <br><br>The blubber-like layer found in Ichthyosaurs would
                                  also have supported the idea that they were warm blooded, as blubber is commonly seen 
                                  in many warm blooded marine animals today. Additional scientific testing on these fossils
                                   have also confirmed the presence of specialized cells that contain pigments called melanin. 
                                   These pigments are also found in modern day marine animals that help disguise and regulate 
                                   their body temperature. <br><br> The presence of modern day structures in the ancient Ichthyosaur 
                                   provide insight into the developmental and evolutionary history of marine animals today. 
                                   The cells from these fossils are one of the oldest cells ever found, and although they are 
                                   under continued study today, their discovery has allowed scientist to develop deeper 
                                   understandings of patterns and relationships between ancient and modern marine life; 
                                   far more than fossil bones can.

                                     Large concentrations of a well preserved species of Ichthyosaur 
                                     were found in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile. This Ichthyosaur
                                      fossil site was significant because approximately 40 adult and juvenile
                                       Ichthyosaurs were buried together in groups, along with ammonites, belemnites,
                                        bivalves, and other fishes. The diversity and unique grouping of these fossils 
                                        give valuable information to the conditions during the time of Ichthyosaurs and
                                         their behaviours.<br><br> Many of the other fossils found along side the Ichthyosaurs 
                                         were characteristic of different fossil records of marine environments in the 
                                         early Cretaceous period. These fossils provide support to the Cretaceous period,
                                          as zone fossils that were unique to certain paleoenvironments. The pairing of adult
                                           with juvenile Ichthyosaurs also suggested that they hunted together in groups for
                                            their prey. These fossil findings showed that viewing new fossil findings through 
                                            the lense of paleontology allows one to more accurately inquire and formulate supported 
                                            hypothesis about the past.
